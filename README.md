### Notes
I originally had an issue getting the posters to load on the collection view. The problem was i accidentally copied the incorrect link so XCode had no posters to draw from.

### Notes
The version of XCode I am using is slightly newer than the one shown in the video, so there are some buttons that I do not have. For a couple of steps I had to find a different way to do what was being demonstrated in the video.
